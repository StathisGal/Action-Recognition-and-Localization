# Action Recognition and Localization
This is the github repo of my master's thesis, titled as "Action Recognition and Localization in Videos"

## Pretrained ResNet 3D
In order to extract 3D features, I use a pretrained 3D ResNet 34 which was available from [here](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch)

## Requirements
You can find all required packages in requirements.txt file

## TODO
+ Demo file
+ Clear code
